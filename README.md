# Week 05 - To Do List Challenge

**Author:** Peter C. Matthews

This repository contains my submission for the [Master Coding](https://wearecodenation.com/2022/04/25/master-coding/) course at *CodeNation*.

## Brief

**Overview:**

Create a Mongoose application that connects to a MongoDB database.

**Requirements:**
 - Create the following routes:
   - POST - adds a book to the database
   - GET - gets all books from the database
   - PUT - updates a books author
   - DELETE - deletes a single book from the database
 - Have your application separated into server /model/routes/controllers

**Stretch Goals:**
 - Use dynamic updates to search on a book name and update any field
 - Delete all entries to the database, as well as deleting a single entry
 - Find a single book by the title: [https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)
 - For this, research `req.params`: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/expressjs-req-params-property/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/expressjs-req-params-property/)

**Personal Stretch Goals:**

 - Implement the CQRS pattern, splitting read and write operations.
 - Add the following routes:
   - PATCH - allows partial updates for a book in the database.
   - OPTIONS - show the HTTP verbs that are available for a particular route.
   - HEAD - respond with just the header of the response, and perform no actions.
 - Explore best practices for MongoDB schema design.
